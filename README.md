# Random Walks For Quantum Mechanics

This was the first Python project I ever completed for university, and my first Python project ever.

In quantum mechanics, it is common to model an 'energy well' - a situation where a quantum particle is trapped between two walls of potential. i.e. between two atomic particles. From there, we attempt to model the ground state energy of the particle trapped in this state.

This Python program models Pearsons 'random walk' problem specifically for quantum mechanics. The problem is as follows: a 'drunkard' walks one step randomly in the x or y, selected randomly, going forwards or backwards - also decided randomly. Eventually, the drunkard reaches the barrier and is arrested - ending the walk.

This can be used to model an energy well - where the edge of the walk is analogous to the edge of the well. By defining the distance of the boundary to the centre, where the walk begins, and finding the rate of arrest, we can use this to solve Schroedinger's equation and find the ground state energy.
